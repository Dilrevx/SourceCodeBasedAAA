# About this directory

From the main readme:

`feature_extraction.py` automatically reads all applications inside `apk/$database_name` folder. The structure of the folders must be like below:

```
/apk
-/$database_name
--/$developer_name
---/*.apk
```

#### SDK-ID modifications

Symlink $SRCAAA_DB to here, such that we have two dbs.
